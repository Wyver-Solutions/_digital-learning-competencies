<div class="col-12">

  <p>The framework is based on 30 areas, each containing 3 levels:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Level 1: Foundation</li>
    <li>Level 2: Practitioner</li>
    <li>Level 3: Advanced</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The levels are an indication of the amount of responsibility a person may have in this area.</p>
  <p>Feel free to use it for non-commercial purposes.</p>
  <p>To incorporate the competencies into your project, you can add them as a git submodule:</p>
  <p><code>git submodule add https://github.com/Wyver-Solutions/_elearning-competencies _elearning-competencies</code></p>
  <p>The underscore is so they work directly as a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/" target="_blank">Jekyll collection</a>. You will need to run the above command inside your Collections directory, and then use <code>git pull</code> inside the submodule whenever you want to update.</p>
  <p>If you wish to use the framework commercially, please contact <a href="https://www.wyversolutions.co.uk" target="_blank">Wyver Solutions Ltd</a></p>
