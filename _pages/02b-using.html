<div class="col-12">
  <p>Feel free to use the framework for non-commercial purposes.</p>
  <p>If you wish to use the framework commercially, please contact <a href="https://www.wyversolutions.co.uk" target="_blank">Wyver Solutions Ltd</a></p>


  <h2>Framework Structure</h2>

  <p>The framework is designed around six competency areas, each divided into five sub-categories.</p>

  <p>Within each sub-category there are three level descriptors:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Level 1: Foundation</li>
    <li>Level 2: Practioner</li>
    <li>Level 3: Advanced</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each level descriptor says what a person should be able to do who is working at that level in that area.</p>

  <p>Descriptors use Bloom's taxonomy of verbs. See: <a href="https://tips.uark.edu/using-blooms-taxonomy/" target="_blank">https://tips.uark.edu/using-blooms-taxonomy/</a></p>

  <h2>File Structure</h2>

  <p>Each competency area is described within a single file.</p>

  <p>These files use the YAML format, which is a way of structuring data in a human &amp; computer-readable way.</p>

  <p>Within the top section of the file you will find the data for the framework. It is stored between three dashes (---):</p>

  <pre><code>
  ---
  title: The competency area
  ID: The ID code for the competency area
  description: The description of the competency area
  items: The list of sub-categories
  - ID: The ID code for the sub-category
    name: The name of the sub-category
    L1: The descriptor for level 1
    L2: The descriptor for level 2
    L3: The descriptor for level 3
  - ID: The next sub-category ID code
    name: etc
  ---
  </code></pre>

  <h2>Note to developers</h2>

  <p>This set of files is designed primarily to work as a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/" target="_blank">Jekyll collection</a>, but can also be used in any system which can iterate over files and over the YAML data contained within them.</p>

  <p>To incorporate the competencies into your project, you can add them as a git submodule:</p>
  <p><code>git submodule add https://github.com/Wyver-Solutions/_elearning-competencies _elearning-competencies</code></p>
  <p>The underscore is so the files work directly as a Jekyll collection.</p>
  <p>You will need to run the above command inside your Collections directory, and then use <code>git pull</code> inside the submodule whenever you want to update.</p>
