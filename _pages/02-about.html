<p>At Wyver Solutions, we have led and supported learning technology projects since 2006.</p>

<p>Our founder, Mark Berthelemy, has spent over 30 years involved at the intersection of education, business and learning technology.</p>

<p>We want to support the next generation of elearning specialists to create learning experiences, resources and systems that make a difference.</p>

<p>Our open source <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/competencies">competency framework</a> has been created by and for the industry. It sets the standard for professionals working in a broad range of roles across the elearning industry.</p>

<p>To accompany the framework, we have created the <a href="{{ site.academy-url }}">Wyver Academy</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Free <a href="{{ site.academy-url }}/assessment">self-assessment</a> tools to help you identify your strengths</li>
  <li>A challenging <a href="{{ site.academy-url }}/coaching">coaching programme</a> designed to help you fill gaps</li>
  <li>A range of <a href="{{ site.academy-url }}/certification">certifications</a> to provide the evidence you need to show that you have broad and deep skills in elearning</li>
</ul>
